# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict the risk of heart disease based on various health parameters. Built as a real-world Data Science project for portfolio and job readiness.

## 🔍 Dataset
- Source: UCI / Kaggle Heart Disease Dataset
- Features: Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Cholesterol, ECG, Max Heart Rate, etc.
- Target: 1 = Disease Present, 0 = No Disease

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn

## 📊 Model Used
- Logistic Regression (baseline model)
- Accuracy: ~85-90% (based on dataset split)

## 📈 Results
Confusion matrix, classification report, and data visualizations included.

## 💼 Goal
✅ Add to portfolio  
✅ Strengthen MLSA & Job Applications  
✅ Prepare for real-world DS use cases
